# Reddit_Comment_Scraper_Bok

This is the comment scraper and I used Prof Foote and this person's code to make it work.

Simply do !git clone (the url of this repository) in jupyter lab and the folder will come up with all of the code that you can then use. If you want to use the comments that I found then download the csv.
