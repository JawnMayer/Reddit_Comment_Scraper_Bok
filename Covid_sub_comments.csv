So, the agony goes on and on, opening and closing, opening and closing ... until the vaccines were to provide the silver bullet. 

Too bad they didn't. There are vaccine breakthroughs and vaccines seem to do little to prevent infection with the new variant. Would vaccines prevent the evolution of new variants?

It just takes one immunocompromised patient for a new variant to evolve. And since immunocompromised patients often don't show good immune response to vaccines, new variants are likely to continue to evolve.

It's social dysfunction that's the problem, not vaccines.","If Biden confronts and humiliates Putin, the left will be energized since it's basically beating up Trump's dad at the playground by proxy.

I won't talk about other viruses, but there is no evolutionary pressure for SARS-CoV-2 to become less severe, which is confirmed by previous variants. There is a lot of wishful thinking about the mild Omicron, but if the pandemic has shown one thing, it is that the virus doesn't care about our wishful thinking. 

In Gauteng, Omicron has already resulted in a rise of hospitalization that is steeper than for the Delta wave.

6,Men definitely drink more than women and get sloppy drunk more than women.,"Background. Outdoor environmental variables, such as cold temperatures and low wind speed, have been correlated with incidence and mortality from Covid-19 (caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus). However, as Covid-19 predominantly spreads indoors, the degree to which outdoor environmental variables might directly cause disease spread is unclear. Methods. World regions were considered to have reliable data if the excess mortality did not greatly exceed reported Covid-19 mortality. The relative risk of Covid-19 mortality for 142 regions as a function of median weekly temperature and wind speed was determined. For instance, Covid-19 mortality following warm weeks in a country was compared with mortality following cold weeks in the same country. Results. Covid-19 mortality increases with cooling from 20 C to close to freezing (0 to 4 C, p<0.001). The relation of Covid-19 mortality with temperature demonstrates a maximum close to freezing. Below -5 C, the decrease in mortality with further cooling was statistically significant (p<0.01). With warming above room temperature (20 to 24 C), there is a nonsignificant trend for mortality to increase again. A literature review demonstrated that window opening and indoor ventilation tend to increase with warming in the range from freezing to room temperature. Conclusion. The steep decline in Covid-19 mortality with warming in the range from freezing to room temperature may relate to window opening and less indoor crowding when it is comfortable outside. Below freezing, all windows are closed, and further cooling increases stack ventilation (secondary to indoor-outdoor temperature differences) and thereby tends to decrease Covid-19 mortality. Opening windows and other tools for improving indoor ventilation may decrease the spread of Covid-19.","I've noticed some jaw pain on both my upper and lower jaw as well, although I think my upper jaw pain is probably just from sleeping weird.",Wow this blew my mind. It's refreshing to see well thought out and informed comments and posts like this,"If a virus with one or two mutations is transmitted from one host to another, the mutation is usually cancelled out when it returns to the pool of wild viruses in the population. In other words, it's highly unlikely that the 50 odd mutations of Omicron mutated in 50 individuals before they added up in one host.

If an immunocompromised patient can't clear the virus for many months, it has the opportunity to add up many mutations in that patient as it fights the deficient immune system and/or any monoclonal treatment such a patient may be given. Since the patient can't clear the virus, the virus gets better at surviving in the host.

The mutations are on an individual level what the variants are on the social level. Like the individual that can't clear the virus brings about new mutations, a society that can't deal with the pandemic brings about new variants.","But we have to judge based on it being specifically marriage. If we go by civil unions, then we'd have to look at where civil unions started everywhere else (which I'm not going to do).",I think it's a good idea as long as both creators and discord aren't able to abuse it but only time will tell if that happens.,"TBH nowhere is ""good"" right now, but Mexico is still one of your better bets (for better or worse).

No entry requirements into the country â€” be it Covid test or vaxx-pass. It's one of the handful of countries (maybe the only one?) in the entire world where this is true.

Resorts have been hurting down here so although the Covid tests for return are still a pain in the ass and a completely ridiculous expense, they're making them as easy as possible to get â€” often available without leaving the grounds.

Travel everywhere is hell, but Mexico's only like the first circle whereas other countries are like up close to the eighth or ninth.","They donâ€™t reduce chances of catching Covid. The vaccine increases your chances of surviving Covid, but you can still catch/spread even if your vaccinated."
7,"It is a mistranslation.

8,"This is a typical phase 1.  The low sample size is fine because you're measuring immunogenicity directly, not relying on low-probability random events.

A 41-fold antibody reduction means protection against infection for 2-dose vaccinees is going to be really low.  Third doses or prior infection will at least give higher protective immunity but may still be really low.","**Reminder:** This post contains a **preprint** that has **not been peer-reviewed.**
