This is very good news because it means our tools (like vaccines) are still useful. If the virus found a different door, this may not have been the case.\\n\\n-\\n\\n>we’re going to see an increase in breakthrough cases, especially among those with 2 vaccines. But this study gives me great hope that our boosters will help protect against Omicron. In addition, and importantly, neutralizing antibodies are not our only defense. We have other antibodies, B-cell factories, and T-cells (I explained them here) that will also help protect against severe disease and death. It will take time and more data to determine if we need an Omicron-specific booster.\\n\\n-\\n\\n>We’re starting to get data from the UK and it’s really not looking good. On Dec. 2, 2% of their PCR swabs were positive for Omicron. This is compared to less than 0.01% positive PCRs on Nov 20. Mathematical models estimated an R(t) of 3.47 in the UK right now. This is likely an overestimation, but even the best case scenario (i.e. lower bound) of the R(t) is concerning at 2.75. This tells us that high levels of Delta and/or immunity are not stopping Omicron in the UK. And it probably won’t stop Omicron in the United States either. We need to continue to watch this, but this is not a great start at all.\\n\\n-\\n\\n>Among a sample of 42 COVID patients in the hospital on Dec. 2, most were hospitalized “with COVID19” not “for COVID19.” Among the 42 patients, 9 (21%) had a diagnosis of COVID19 pneumonia. Among the 9 pneumonia patients, 8 were unvaccinated and 1 was a child. There were 4 patients in high care and 1 in the ICU.\\nThis is a very important on-the-ground perspective.

Rabies and tetanus are both immunized using passive immunity, which basically adds the antibodies into your body without activating your long term immune system. This means that the protection you have from these diseases lessens much quicker over time, usually around 1-5 years (still would be too fast for COVID vaccine.) The vaccines for COVID, Shingles, and Pertussis all cause active immunity in the body. This means it activates the memory cells to remember the markers for those diseases, creating immunity to the strands introduced for a minimum of 5 years if you are immunocompromised and if you are healthy it will last far longer. Boosters for passive diseases are used as precautions when exposed to a possible trigger. Boosters are given in these scenarios because your body does not match the intensity of active immunity. The active immunity granted by the vaccines produce their own antibodies and rely on memory cells, which stay in the body for decades. This is where my confusion is.

As long as you continue following your government's recommendations, perform proper hand hygiene (and masking if recommended where you live), and continue to get vaccinated, there's nothing more you can do on an individual level. Governments, scientists and leaders can assume the worst as it helps them be proactive, but citizens can and should think positively and read optimistic news if it will help them mentally. Mental health is JUST as important as physical health. And if reading optimistic COVID news will help with your mental health, PLEASE by all means read as much as you can.\\n\\nI never said don't think about COVID. In fact, I have said several times to make sure you're boostered (if eligible), continue to wash your hands, stay home when you're ill and mask up (if recommended in your area). But in reality, this virus will be with us forever. But we cannot live in isolation forever as that is absolutely a shitty way to live and can destroy us mentally. As long as you're vaccinated, it's completely acceptable to get back out there and live your life as long as you're taking some non-intrusive precautions. I'm going to a wedding this weekend with 100 people... my first one in 2 years!I disagree that long-COVID would be the worst thing for your mental health. Long-COVID, which is poorly understood and current research us subject to A LOT of recall bias, is uncommon. In vaccinated people, it's estimated to impact 5% of cases. Prolonged symptoms can and does happen after ANY infection. I once had a cold about 5 years ago and had a cough that lasted for months afterwards (young, healthy with no underlying conditions... was 22 years old at the time). The cough was so severe that I bruised ribs and it felt like knives stabbing me every time I took a breath. I would STILL rather have this compared to the severe anxiety that the bad news related to the pandemic is causing. Long-COVID impacts a minority of people. Being bombarded with only bad news and more and more restrictions will have a MUCH bigger impact on the public's mental health than Long-COVID.\",\n",

Conclusion In patients hospitalized with Covid-19, the use of thymic peptides reported no side effects, adverse events, or deaths by day 20. \\nWhen compared with registry data, a significantly shorter time to recovery and mortality reduction was measured. \\nThe Catholic University of Honduras Medical Research Group (GIMUNICAH) is working on a more extensive phase 3 trial.',\n",

       "  'Background. Outdoor environmental variables, such as cold temperatures and low wind speed, have been correlated with incidence and mortality from Covid-19 (caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus). However, as Covid-19 predominantly spreads indoors, the degree to which outdoor environmental variables might directly cause disease spread is unclear. Methods. World regions were considered to have reliable data if the excess mortality did not greatly exceed reported Covid-19 mortality. The relative risk of Covid-19 mortality for 142 regions as a function of median weekly temperature and wind speed was determined. For instance, Covid-19 mortality following warm weeks in a country was compared with mortality following cold weeks in the same country. Results. Covid-19 mortality increases with cooling from 20 C to close to freezing (0 to 4 C, p<0.001). The relation of Covid-19 mortality with temperature demonstrates a maximum close to freezing. Below -5 C, the decrease in mortality with further cooling was statistically significant (p<0.01). With warming above room temperature (20 to 24 C), there is a nonsignificant trend for mortality to increase again. A literature review demonstrated that window opening and indoor ventilation tend to increase with warming in the range from freezing to room temperature. Conclusion. The steep decline in Covid-19 mortality with warming in the range from freezing to room temperature may relate to window opening and less indoor crowding when it is comfortable outside. Below freezing, all windows are closed, and further cooling increases stack ventilation (secondary to indoor-outdoor temperature differences) and thereby tends to decrease Covid-19 mortality. Opening windows and other tools for improving indoor ventilation may decrease the spread of Covid-19.',\n",

       "  \">The emergence of the Omicron variant (1) of SARS-CoV-2 in November 2021 in South Africa has \\r\\nraised concerns that, based on the large number of mutations in the spike protein and elsewhere on \\r\\nthe virus (https://covdb.stanford.edu/page/mutation-viewer/#sec_b-1-351), this variant will have \\r\\nconsiderable escape from vaccine elicited immunity. Furthermore, several mutations in the receptor \\r\\nbinding domain and S2 are predicted to impact transmissibility and affinity for ACE-2. \\r\\nHere we investigated whether Omicron escapes antibody neutralization elicited by the Pfizer \\r\\nBNT162b2 mRNA vaccine and whether the virus still requires binding to the ACE2 receptor to infect \\r\\ncells. We used an early passage of isolated and sequence confirmed live Omicron virus isolated in \\r\\nSouth Africa. We used a human lung cell line clone (H1299-ACE2) engineered to express the ACE2 \\r\\nreceptor (2) to both isolate the virus and test neutralization. We also tested growth in the parental \\r\\nH1299 which do not overexpress ACE2 and are not appreciably infectable with SARS-CoV-2 (Fig S1).\\r\\nThe H1299-ACE2 cells were similar to Vero-E6 in titer dependent focus formation, but were \\r\\nconsiderably more sensitive (Fig S2).\\r\\nWe observed that Omicron infected the ACE2-expressing cells in a concentration dependent manner \\r\\nbut did not infect the parental H1299 cells, indicating that ACE2 is required for Omicron entry (Fig. \\r\\n1A). We then tested the ability of plasma from BNT162b2 vaccinated study participants to neutralize \\r\\nOmicron versus ancestral D614G virus in a live virus neutralization assay. We tested 14 plasma \\r\\nsamples from 12 participants (Table S1), with 6 having no previous record of SARS-CoV-2 infection \\r\\nnor detectable nucleocapsid antibodies indicative of previous infection. For two of these \\r\\nparticipants, we used samples from two timepoints. The remaining 6 participants had a record of \\r\\nprevious infection in the first SARS-CoV-2 infection wave in South Africa where infection was with \\r\\nancestral D614G virus (Table S1). Geometric mean titer (GMT) FRNT50 (inverse of the plasma \\r\\ndilution required for 50% reduction in infection foci number) was 1321 for D614G. These samples \\r\\ntherefore had very strong neutralization of D614G virus, consistent with sampling soon after \\r\\nvaccination. GMT FRNT50 for the same samples was 32 for Omicron, a 41-fold decline (Fig 1B). \\r\\nHowever, the escape was incomplete, with 5 of the participants, all previously infected, showing \\r\\nrelatively high neutralization titers with Omicron. \\r\\nBeta variant escape from BNT162b2 in a live virus neutralization assay has been reported to be \\r\\nsubstantial (3) and our own data confirmed these results (4), with about 3-fold reduction in FRNT50. \\r\\nThe results we present here with Omicron show much more extensive escape. However, escape was \\r\\nincomplete in participants with higher FRNT50 due to previous infection. Previous infection,\\r\\nfollowed by vaccination or booster is likely to increase the neutralization level and likely confer\\r\\nprotection from severe disease in Omicron infection.\\n\\n\\nSorry for no paragraphs, but at least it's not 7zipped.\",\n",

Has there been any tracking of the efforts to apply this knowledge in the real world? Websites like Our World in Data have detailed vaccination trackers: would it be feasible to create a database of where in the world HEPA filters are already the standard for air recirculation systems (or at least the standard in hospital settings and the like), where they aren't, and to track any actions to implement them more widely?\\n\\n2) Likewise, wastewater monitoring is known to be another useful tool. Can a similar global database/tracker be created to represent the extent of its adoption globally?\\n\\n3) With the continued difficulty in ensuring adequate vaccine coverage in low-income countries, it would seem like knowing pre-existing seroprevalence there would be very important. I understand the argument that a healthcare system capable of conducting a good seroprevalence study would be capable of just distributing vaccines in the first place by now. Nevertheless, it seems like one such study [was conducted](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.11.18.21266496v1) earlier this year in Bangui, so I was wondering if conducting similar studies in the key cities of the other low-income countries would still be feasible/worthwhile by now.\\n\\n4) Earlier on, I often heard concerns about the reservoir wild animal populations.

I doubt you can;   -- You are right, that is not the kind of statement that quality sources would provide at this point.\\n\\nIn terms of your statement of \"Covid-19 is a respiratory illness with vascular components.\" - I am glad to see some common ground between us, the fact that ACE2 receptors are targeted by the virus and that ACE2 receptors are expressed throughout the body should be enough to not discount a \\'mechanism for long-covid\\' out of hand I would say.\\n\\nHere are some excerpts and sources re cardiovascular / systemic involvement:\\nAbstract: “SARS-CoV-2 usually enters the human body from the respiratory tract and gradually causes systemic disease. The disease is mild in 81% and severe in the balance. The virus causes multiorgan damage and primarily damages airway epithelium, small intestine epithelium, and vascular endothelium, which are organs with high angiotensin-converting enzyme (angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 [ACE2] expression). The most affected organ is the lungs, and the cardiovascular system follows it closely.”\\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7574017/\\n\\n\\nAbstract: “Disease progression from COVID-19 infection has shown significant symptom manifestations within organ systems beyond the respiratory system. The literature has shown increasing evidence of cardiovascular involvement during disease course and an associated increase in mortality among infected patients. Although the understanding of this novel virus is continually evolving, it is currently proposed that the mechanism by which the SARS-CoV-2 virus contributes to cardiovascular manifestations involves the ACE2 transmembrane protein. The protein ACE2 is highly expressed in blood vessel pericytes, and infection can result in microvascular dysfunction and subsequent acute coronary syndromes. \\n\\nRisk factors of cardiovascular involvement in COVID-19 infection:\\n“Disease progression from COVID-19 infection shows symptom manifestations within organ systems beyond the respiratory system. In a previous report, a patient infected with SARS-CoV-2 developed left ventricular dysfunction and pericarditis without any respiratory symptoms [12]. Complications involving cardiovascular system include MI (7.2%–27.8%), arrhythmias (5.9%–16.7%), shock (1.1%–20%), and heart failure (23%) [11]. Coagulation abnormalities and myocarditis have also been reported in various reports [3,11,13]. While the understanding of the novel virus is continuously evolving, the mechanism through which the SARS-CoV-2 virus leads to cardiovascular manifestations is currently suggested to involve the ACE2 transmembrane protein [3]. It is well known that the ACE2 protein is found throughout the body, including the ileum, kidney, adipose tissue, heart, brainstem, lungs, and nasal and oral mucosa, which may explain the symptoms and complications commonly seen with infection [14]. The ACE2 protein is highly expressed in pericytes of blood vessels, and infection could lead to microvascular dysfunction and subsequent acute coronary syndromes [3].”\\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1521689621000082\\n\\n\\nAbstract:\\n“Recent evidence indicates that a large proportion of deaths from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can be attributed to cardiovascular disease, including acute myocardial infarction, arrhythmias and heart failure. Indeed, severe infection increases the risk of heart failure among patients with COVID-19. In most patients, heart failure arises from complex interactions between pre-existing conditions, cardiac injury, renin-angiotensin system activation, and the effects of systemic inflammation on the cardiovascular system. In this review, we summarize current knowledge regarding pathogen-driven heart failure occurring during treatment for COVID-19, the potential effects of commonly used cardiovascular and anti-infective drugs in these patients, and possible directions for establishing a theoretical basis for clinical treatment.”\\nhttps://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fcvm.2021.629958/full\\n\\nPerhaps you could let me know if blood-thinners are still used in treatment regiments?',\n",

If herd immunity is lost (so far this has only happened due to more contagious variants) then we've seen covid spread extraordinarily quickly even if a significant amount of population immunity remains.  An initial reproductive rate of 1.3, fairly common,  results in something like a 25% population attack rate.  If some number of vaccine doses takes the place of each infection the surge can be mitigated.\\n\\nColorado is an example here; Delta was surging significantly into November when the health department asked everyone to get a third dose.  Through November 1.4% of the population tested positive and 22% of the population got a vaccine dose.  We can't know exactly what effect each of those two had on bringing the surge to an end at a fraction the death rate other places have had,  but the infections (and deaths resulting from them) cost at least 100 times more than the vaccine doses. \\n\\n> What data is justifying the 6 month booster shot?\\n\\nEvery previous vaccine has required a prime and a boost dose to get long lasting cellular immunity; the real question is what data made us think covid would be different.  But the trials and real world data speak for themselves: a 6 month third dose raises immunity much higher than after the second dose,  giving measurably higher protection against hospitalization if infected (presumed to be driven by cellular immunity and long lasting) and a many fold reduction in infection (giving a far larger,  but presumably not long lasting,  societal and individual benefit).\",\n",

Given that neither the structural information nor the experimentally-derived antibody interaction of this variant are available, we have turned to predictive computational methods to model the mutated structure of the spike protein's receptor binding domain and posit potential changes to vaccine efficacy.

The primary endpoint was the geometric mean ratio (GMR) of serum SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike IgG concentrations measured by ELISA in heterologous versus homologous schedules at 28 days after the second dose, with a non-inferiority criterion of the GMR above 0·63 for the one-sided 98·75% CI. The primary analysis was on the per-protocol population, who were seronegative at baseline. Safety analyses were done for all participants who received a dose of study vaccine. The trial is registered with ISRCTN, number 27841311.\\n\\nFindings\\n\\nBetween April 19 and May 14, 2021, 1072 participants were enrolled at a median of 9·4 weeks after receipt of a single dose of ChAd (n=540, 47% female) or BNT (n=532, 40% female). In ChAd-primed participants, geometric mean concentration (GMC) 28 days after a boost of SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike IgG in recipients of ChAd/m1273 (20\\u2009114 ELISA laboratory units [ELU]/mL [95% CI 18\\u2009160 to 22\\u2009279]) and ChAd/NVX (5597 ELU/mL [4756 to 6586]) was non-inferior to that of ChAd/ChAd recipients (1971 ELU/mL [1718 to 2262]) with a GMR of 10·2 (one-sided 98·75% CI 8·4 to ∞) for ChAd/m1273 and 2·8 (2·2 to ∞) for ChAd/NVX, compared with ChAd/ChAd. In BNT-primed participants, non-inferiority was shown for BNT/m1273 (GMC 22\\u2009978 ELU/mL [95% CI 20\\u2009597 to 25\\u2009636]) but not for BNT/NVX (8874 ELU/mL [7391 to 10\\u2009654]), compared with BNT/BNT (16\\u2009929 ELU/mL [15\\u2009025 to 19\\u2009075]) with a GMR of 1·3 (one-sided 98·75% CI 1·1 to ∞) for BNT/m1273 and 0·5 (0·4 to ∞) for BNT/NVX, compared with BNT/BNT; however, NVX still induced an 18-fold rise in GMC 28 days after vaccination. There were 15 serious adverse events, none considered related to immunisation.\\n\\nInterpretation\\n\\nHeterologous second dosing with m1273, but not NVX, increased transient systemic reactogenicity compared with homologous schedules. Multiple vaccines are appropriate to complete primary immunisation following priming with BNT or ChAd, facilitating rapid vaccine deployment globally and supporting recognition of such schedules for vaccine certification.',\n",

The idea that we can give the vulnerable 1-2 doses and then let everyone catch Delta in a massive surge that has most of the population sick at the same time still leads to a really bad scenario.

While this happens, you may suffer a breakthrough infection, but for most people this is brief and mild. In some cases, it is desirable to prevent the breakthrough infection altogether, hence even young and healthy people are encouraged to get boosters in some regions - the boosters can bring antibody levels back up and prevent breakthrough infections. Multiple exposures usually teach the immune system that this pathogen is here to stay and maintain a higher level of antibodies than before, and that should happen after the boosters too, but we obviously don't have long-term data yet.

These real-life issues of immune imprinting have implications for optimal design of second-generation variant spike vaccine boosters in parts of the world experiencing different VOCs, or in assessing heterogeneity in the quantity, quality, and durability of immune protection in those who have experienced different combinations of infecting and vaccinating sequences. Infection by B.1.1.7 had different features to Wuhan Hu-1 in terms of protection against VOC, evident in the response to infection and in the differential impact of vaccine-boosting previously described (8, 9, 11–14). Differential skewing of the immune repertoire may occur if the prime/boost is through B.1.1.7, since epitope modification at DY144 and N501Y changes the nAb repertoire (4, 35). We found a differential hierarchy of cross-neutralization to VOC after natural infection, one or two vaccine doses, depending on the infecting strain. That different immune priming by B.1.1.7 is likely a consequence of heterologous virus per se and not of a shorter timespan for affinity maturation is supported by data from Israel, confirming that susceptibility grows with time and with declining Ab levels (36). Vaccine programs currently use prototypic Wuhan Hu-1 sequence against a background of infection by different VOC predominating in different parts of the world. Decoding the differential breadth of VOC neutralizing response ensuing from diverse priming combinations will affect which variant spike sequences may best serve in second generation vaccines. This appears a more complex choice than simply opting for the most concerning variant at any given time. Since heterologous combinations can confer a diminished response against other variants, there may be a case for sticking with the Wuhan Hu-1 sequence in booster vaccinations in the first instance in the face of unknown future VOCs, or for improved efforts to define vaccines based on optimization of common, conserved, neutralizing epitopes (37). In any case, the inference from this cohort is that populations infected during waves of different variants carry distinct immune memory, with implications for differential protection against future VOCs.',\n",

The disease is also to a large extent associated with increased clot formation and associated thromboembolic complications, which often ends in the death of the patient. This manifests itself among other things through the development of a pulmonary embolism, a stroke or a heart attack up to multi-organ failure in connection with a COVID-19 clinical picture. Intensive medical treatment is then not only necessary because of the original infection, but also because of the thrombosis.\\n\\n\\n> The connection between Sars-CoV2 infection and thrombosis and embolism is significant: Venous thromoboembolism - including deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism - occurs in up to every third Sars-CoV2-infected person in the intensive care unit, even if prophylactic anticoagulation was used. From a medical point of view, an infection with the coronavirus not only leads to generalized inflammation in the body, but also to an overreaction of other defense mechanisms, including the blood coagulation system. Already at the beginning of the pandemic it was reported from clinical studies that increased levels of the coagulation protein fibrinogen and other specific thrombosis biomarkers were detectable in the blood of the infected, which indicated an increased activation of blood coagulation.\\n\\n> This is where an international research team headed by the Justus Liebig University in Giessen (JLU) comes in: In a study published in the journal “BLOOD Advances”, the doctors examined the coagulation parameters, the structure of the fibrin thrombi and the Coagulability in blood plasma in COVID-19 and influenza. The microscopic and functional investigations show that \"corona thrombi\" were formed much more effectively and had a denser and more stable clot network than those of influenza patients or the healthy control group.\\n\\n> The team around Prof. Malgorzata Wygrecka (Center for Infection and Genomics of the Lung, Department of Medicine at JLU) and Prof. em. Klaus T. Preissner (Senior Scientist at the Kerckhoff Heart Research Institute, Faculty of Medicine at JLU) placed coagulation factor XII at the center of further investigations: “We observe in corona patient plasmas that the coagulation factor activated there additionally heats up blood coagulation and thus increases it Can contribute to clot formation, ”explains Prof. Wygrecka. In addition, the thrombi from the corona patient plasmas were very resistant to dissolution (fibrinolysis), as those affected also had increased levels of fibrinolysis inhibitors in their blood. This suggests that \"corona thrombi\" can have a longer lifespan and thus contribute to thromboembolic complications in the affected person. In addition, massive thrombus deposits in vessels and alveoli to which factor XII / XIIa was bound were found in the lung tissue of deceased corona patients, which supports the results so far.\\n\\n> The investigations of the research team coordinated from Gießen, which has been working together for years and is funded in several research associations by the German Research Foundation (DFG), allow the conclusion that the already known \"hypercoagulation\" in the blood of corona infected people mainly affects the Activation of the coagulation factor XII and the subsequent reactions described can be traced back. The team recommends that the medical societies include factor XII / XIIa as a causal factor for thrombosis in their guidelines for thrombosis prophylaxis and therapy for corona patients.\\n\\n> \"Since it is possible to inhibit factor XIIa using specific inhibitors that have already been researched, an effective antithrombotic therapy could be carried out in corona patients without their physiological hemostasis and wound healing being impaired,\" explains Prof. Preissner. The extent to which these conclusions from the scientific work can also be implemented clinically is to be checked in further studies in the near future. https://www.uni-giessen.de/ueber-uns/pressestelle/pm/pm167-21CoronaundThrombose',\n",
       "  '> Abstract\\n\\n> The high incidence of thrombotic events suggests a possible role of the contact system pathway in COVID-19 pathology. Here, we demonstrate altered levels of factor XII (FXII) and its activation products in critically ill COVID-19 patients in comparison to patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome due to influenza virus (ARDS-influenza). Compatible with this data, we report rapid consumption of FXII in COVID-19, but not in ARDS-influenza, plasma. Interestingly, the lag phase in fibrin formation, triggered by the FXII activator kaolin, was not prolonged in COVID-19 as opposed to ARDS-influenza. Using confocal and electron microscopy, we showed that increased FXII activation rate, in conjunction with elevated fibrinogen levels, triggers formation of fibrinolysis-resistant, compact clots with thin fibers and small pores in COVID-19. Accordingly, clot lysis was markedly impaired in COVID-19 as opposed to ARDS-infleunza subjects. Dysregulatated fibrinolytic system, as evidenced by elevated levels of thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor, tissue-plasminogen activator, and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 in COVID-19 potentiated this effect.

Has there been any updates to this? \\n\\nI remember reading some older review by Hope-Simpson on influenza (https://virologyj.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1743-422X-5-29) where it was reported that human challenges with the flu had issues infecting people. Throughout the pandemic, I have hypothesized that the variability in susceptibility to infections may be a major driver that could explain certain aspects, such as the apparent seasonality. \\n\\nSome studies show that certain aspects of immunity in mammals can vary with variations in the length of day, i.e. it's not how long the day is that affects it but whether days are getting shorter or longer. There may be other changes that occur in the spring; overall, the influence of seasons on human health seem poorly studied and understood, but we know certain things happen, such as an increase appetite in the fall, we know about seasonal affective disorder and daylight therapy to counter it, we know certain hormones can show certain seasonal patterns, etc.\\n\\nWhat I mean by all that is that air travelers maybe at a higher risk of respiratory infections not only due to social contacts and exposure, but because the dry air affects our innate immunity in the respiratory system. Holiday gatherings may be especially bad on multiple levels: exposure of course, but people also tend to sleep less, they're tired, they've been drinking, etc. Basically how I would categorize this is that there would be those variations to natural resistance against infections that are semi-permanent (some individuals are more resistant than others due to genetic and/or health status/age), temporary (sleep deprivation, dry air, irritants), and seasonal (people would have on average a lower natural resistance against infections in the fall).\",\n",

       "  'Studies don\\'t support your \"opinion\":\\n\\nPeople who are fully vaccinated against covid-19 are far less likely to infect others, despite the arrival of the delta variant, several studies show. The findings refute the idea, which has become common in some circles, that vaccines no longer do much to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.\\n\\n“They absolutely do reduce transmission,” says Christopher Byron Brooke at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. “Vaccinated people do transmit the virus in some cases, but the data are super crystal-clear that the risk of transmission for a vaccinated individual is much, much lower than for an unvaccinated individual.”\\n\\nA recent study found that vaccinated people infected with the delta variant are 63 per cent less likely to infect people who are unvaccinated.\\n\\nThis is only slightly lower than with the alpha variant, says Brechje de Gier at the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment in the Netherlands, who led the study. Her team had previously found that vaccinated people infected with alpha were 73 per cent less likely to infect unvaccinated people.\\n\\nWhat is important to realise, de Gier says, is that the full effect of vaccines on reducing transmission is even higher than 63 per cent, because most vaccinated people don’t become infected in the first place.\\n\\nDe Gier and her team used data from the Netherlands’ contact tracing system to work out the so-called secondary attack rate – the proportion of contacts infected by positive cases. They then worked out how much this was reduced by vaccination, adjusting for factors such as age.\\n\\nDe Gier says they cannot calculate the full reduction in transmission due to vaccination, because they don’t know exactly how much vaccination reduces the risk of infection. But even assuming vaccination only halves the risk of infection, this would still imply that vaccines reduce transmission by more than 80 per cent overall.\\n\\nOthers have worked out the full effect. Earlier this year, Ottavia Prunas at Yale University applied two different models to data from Israel, where the Pfizer vaccine was used. Her team’s conclusion was that the overall vaccine effectiveness against transmission was 89 per cent.\\n\\nRead more: https://www.newscientist.com/article/2294250-how-much-less-likely-are-you-to-spread-covid-19-if-youre-vaccinated/#ixzz7EO44T3ji',\n",

Overall, “the risk of myocarditis is more than 30 times higher among COVID-19 patients.”\\n\\nWe can also see that in kids, long term affects are close to zero, as long as they get past the beginning incident they are expected to make a full recovery with zero long lasting effects. \\n\\nIn adults it's less so, overall the data suggests that the  91% of cardiologists reported that patients with myocarditis after receiving the COVID-19 were “fully or probably recovered.

The low binding affinity of SARS-CoV-2 to bat ACE2 studied to date does not support Chiroptera as a direct zoonotic agent. Furthermore, the reliance on pangolin coronavirus receptor binding domain (RBD) similarity to SARS-CoV-2 as evidence for natural zoonotic spillover is flawed, as pangolins are unlikely to play a role in SARS-CoV-2′s origin and recombination is not supported by recent analysis. At the same time, genomic analyses pointed out that SARS-CoV-2 exhibits multiple peculiar characteristics not found in other Sarbecoviruses. A novel multibasic furin cleavage site (FCS) confers numerous pathogenetically advantageous capabilities, the existence of which is difficult to explain though natural evolution; SARS-CoV-2 to human ACE2 binding is far stronger than SARS-CoV, yet there is no indication of amount of evolutionary adaptation that SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV underwent. The flat topography of the ganglioside-binding domain (GBD) in the N-terminal domain (NTD) of SARS-CoV-2 does not conform with typical host evasion evolutionary measures exhibited by other human coronaviruses. The combination of binding strength, human and mouse peptide mimicry, as well as high adaptation for human infection and transmission from the earliest strains might suggest the use of humanized mice for the development of SARS-CoV-2 in a laboratory environment. The application of mouse strains expressing human ACE2 for SARS-CoV-related research is well documented (Ren et al. 2008; Hou et al. 2010; Menachery et al. 2015; Cockrell et al. 2018; Jiang et al. 2020). Additionally, culturing and adapting coronaviruses to different cell lines, including human airway epithelial cells, has been experimentally conducted in various laboratories (Tse et al. 2014; Menachery et al. 2015; Zeng et al. 2016; Jiang et al. 2020). While a natural origin is still possible and the search for a potential host in nature should continue, the amount of peculiar genetic features identified in SARS-CoV-2′s genome does not rule out a possible gain-of-function origin, which should be therefore discussed in an open scientific debate.',\n",

Whether declines in effectiveness are due to waning immunity, the B.1.617.2 (delta) variant of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), or other causes is unknown.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nMETHODS\\r  \\nWe used data for 8,690,825 adults in New York State to assess the effectiveness of the BNT162b2, mRNA-1273, and Ad26.COV2.S vaccines against laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 and hospitalization with Covid-19 (i.e., Covid-19 diagnosed at or after admission). We compared cohorts defined according to vaccine product received, age, and month of full vaccination with age-specific unvaccinated cohorts by linking statewide testing, hospital, and vaccine registry databases. We assessed vaccine effectiveness against Covid-19 from May 1 through September 3, 2021, and against hospitalization with Covid-19 from May 1 through August 31, 2021.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nRESULTS\\r  \\nThere were 150,865 cases of Covid-19 and 14,477 hospitalizations with Covid-19. During the week of May 1, 2021, when the delta variant made up 1.8% of the circulating variants, the median vaccine effectiveness against Covid-19 was 91.3% (range, 84.1 to 97.0) for BNT162b2, 96.9% (range, 93.7 to 98.0) for mRNA-1273, and 86.6% (range, 77.8 to 89.7) for Ad26.COV2.S. Subsequently, effectiveness declined contemporaneously in all cohorts, from a median of 93.4% (range, 77.8 to 98.0) during the week of May 1 to a nadir of 73.5% (range, 13.8 to 90.0) around July 10, when the prevalence of the delta variant was 85.3%. By the week of August 28, when the prevalence of the delta variant was 99.6%, the effectiveness was 74.2% (range, 63.4 to 86.8). Effectiveness against hospitalization with Covid-19 among adults 18 to 64 years of age remained almost exclusively greater than 86%, with no apparent time trend. Effectiveness declined from May through August among persons 65 years of age or older who had received BNT162b2 (from 94.8 to 88.6%) or mRNA-1273 (from 97.1 to 93.7%). The effectiveness of Ad26.COV2.S was lower than that of the other vaccines, with no trend observed over time (range, 80.0 to 90.6%).\\r  \\n\\r  \\nCONCLUSIONS\\r  \\nThe effectiveness of the three vaccines against Covid-19 declined after the delta variant became predominant. The effectiveness against hospitalization remained high, with modest declines limited to BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 recipients 65 years of age or older.',\n",

Though I do appreciate the effort you've put into your explanation, it seems weird to me that you've gone ahead and assumed in your first sentence a hypothesis that has very weak evidence to support it.\\n\\nAs for the rest of your explanation, you're just describing how mutations work generically without addressing more specifically why it isn't highly usual for a strain that evolved isolated in a small animal population to outcompete prevailing strains which have had far more opportunities (both in time, and in volume of infection) to adapt to humans. You would expect (the lack of) selective pressure push the mouse lineage towards losing traits that help it to be highly successful in humans, not to gain enough for it to suddenly emerge as the most contegeous version we've seen.\",\n",

Btw. this is not a debate about antivaxxers and if you really wanted to persuade antivaxxers, a good place to start would be for either governments or the companies who developed the vaccines, to not openly refuse to take responsibility for potential sideeffects. Trying to force people to inject vaccines while directly rejecting to pay reparations for potential future damages caused by it, just shows how eagerly you want to create scapegoats for the political failings. Rather that actually aiming to persuade the few remaining people who are unvaccinated by choice and not just because they are refused vaccines by the health industry itself due to underlying health conditions. The unvaccinated people are not to blame for the health crisis continuing. Infected people who continue to run around and spread the virus are to blame for the health crisis continuing. The people at the helm of spreading the unproven claim about herd immunity have admitted that it is not achievable. The human immune system does not maintain efficiency against the this family of virus for long enough. If you want hospitalisations to be *manageable*, you have to do the exact same thing as it takes to actually protect the vulnerable high risk groups anyway. You have to stop the spread of the virus. There is no way of getting around doing what it takes with this one Weedie. Even vaccines against a virus from the measles family of virus, that humans gain almost impenetrable lifelong immunity against after being exposed to one time, will fail if you simply choose to bathe in measles virus daily.

So viruses that do kill hosts, or host cells before maximum replication are less likely to “beat out” other viruses.  \\n\\n2.) mutations seldom cause only one effect, and there is seldom a single mutation.  As you said, it is MUCH more likely that a single mutation will make a virus less deadly… simply because being more deadly requires the unlikely combinations of effects that can do the rather difficult job of defeating the immune system.  The more mutations you have, the less likely they all combined result in a more deadly virus.  Is it possible?  Sure.  But as time and mutations continue to occur, a virus is more likely than not to converge on the evolutionary goal of a virus… which is to spread effectively and replicate.  Killing hosts or host cells is contrary to this goal.\\n\\nFor instance delta was evolutionarily a better virus than COVID 2 because it killed/damaged less host cells.  It killed less people.  Which allowed greater infectiousness.\\n\\nAnd even if we want to throw out “general” knowledge of how viruses evolve and only look at COVID 19… we have seen even in this specific situation a continual move toward the evolutionary goal of a virus.  Delta killed less than covid2.  To be clear you are saying that delta was a “unlikely” mutation, because it kills less?  You’d have to believe that if you believe omicron is likely to be more deadly based on its prevalence.\\n\\nCOVID 1 was most deadly.  COVID 2 less deadly than COVID 1 but more transmission.  Delta less deadly than COVID 2 but more transmission.  To say that omicron is more likely to be more deadly not only defies all trends and knowledge in viruses in general.  It defies the trend of the specific COVID 19 virus which has repeatedly gotten more transmissible and less deadly as time and mutations have gone on.',\n",

This sub used to be very active with uploading science papers on the topic but the traffic here has slowed considerably over time. There could be a ton of causes for a novel virus to have such long base sequence, and when I google for further studies about it, I am not really able to find anything.

Another plothole in the so-called evidence, was that the experts estimated human immune response to sars2 would remain stable at maximum efficiency for up to two years. Why anyone would assume such a thing we can only guess about, because all existing data about virus from the corona family, shows that human immune response only remain at peak capacity for two months, reaching 48% efficiency after six months. Because of the errors in the guesswork the calculations are based on, a board of specialists in centrum for spreading the claim of herd immunity today made a statement that herd immunity is impossible to reach, due to the human immune system not being able to keep up. \\n\\nYou say the goal is to not overburden hospitals, which could be solved by simply limiting the spread of the virus or expanding the hospital system, rather than by hostilely scapegoating people who are unwilling to expose their own body biyearly to modified spike proteins or unable to do so due to health reasons. \\n\\nFinally, you stated that nobody would care about circulating sars2 causing human beings to die by asphyxiation - as long as hospitals does not get too overburdened and for example, start to run out of oxygen to treat the dying with.

Other researchers will test viruses genetically engineered to carry just the spike protein of Omicron, a process that is faster than growing the variant itself but a bit further removed from what happens in real life.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nAs such studies take place, it\\'s crucial to closely monitor any shifts in the pandemic, Farrar says. “Do you see cases increasing not just in South Africa but the broader South African region?” The virus has already been picked up in Belgium, the United Kingdom, and Israel, Farrar points out, and will probably be found elsewhere as well. “Do you see transmission increasing in other parts of the world around presumed index cases?” Epidemiologists will also watch for changes in disease severity—how many people are hospitalized and die. All that will take time.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nIn the meantime, the European Union, the United States, and many other countries have restricted travel to and from southern Africa in a bid to protect themselves. Travel restrictions are unlikely to stop the variant, Farrar says, but they can buy some time. “The question is what you then do with the time.”\\r  \\n\\r  \\nTravel restrictions come with an economic and social cost, which could be a disincentive to report new variants. “I\\'ve heard through the grapevine that countries didn\\'t push sequences out very quickly \\\\[in the past\\\\] because they were worried about travel bans,” says Emma Hodcroft, a virologist at the University of Bern. “This is the opposite of what we want.”\\r  \\n\\r  \\nSuch considerations did not stop South African researchers, de Oliveira says. “We do risk a massive backlash in case \\\\[Omicron\\\\] does not cause a massive wave of infection and can be controlled,“ he wrote in a message. \"But this is a risk that I am comfortable to live with as the pandemic has caused so many deaths and suffering. \\\\[Our\\\\] hope is that our early identification will help the world.“',\n",

The number of people testing positive has risen in areas of South Africa affected by this variant, but epidemiologic studies are underway to understand if it is because of Omicron or other factors.  \\r  \\n\\r  \\nSeverity of disease: It is not yet clear whether infection with Omicron causes more severe disease compared to infections with other variants, including Delta.  Preliminary data suggests that there are increasing rates of hospitalization in South Africa, but this may be due to increasing overall numbers of people becoming infected, rather than a result of specific infection with Omicron.  There is currently no information to suggest that symptoms associated with Omicron are different from those from other variants.  Initial reported infections were among university students—younger individuals who tend to have more mild disease—but understanding the level of severity of the Omicron variant will take days to several weeks.  All variants of COVID-19, including the Delta variant that is dominant worldwide, can cause severe disease or death, in particular for the most vulnerable people, and thus prevention is always key.',\n",

Great news for them but it doesn’t answer the question you are asking, which is whether mild exposures give rise to an immune response. \\n\\nThe Delta variant is so damn infectious (ie measles level R0) that passing exposures are unlikely to trigger the immune response you’re alluding to.

I also see studies that show how the vaccine efficacy decreases over time, but even still show some benefit. I further trust findings that suggest that a booster will increase protection from the virus.  I also see hypothesis that suggest those boosters may decrease in efficacy and that additional boosters may be necessary, but long term data isn\\'t yet available. You may question that as a conspiracy, but it seems fairly transparent to me.\\n\\nI also trust my friends who had COVID and were admitted to ICU. I trust them when they explain how terrible the experience was and the feeling of O2 saturation levels in the 60-70s. I also trust my friends who had heart issues and stroke issues immediately correlated with a COVID infection (blood clot in the eye for a relatively healthy 50 year old who is now partially blind on one side - bummer). I also trust my friends who died of COVID, though they don\\'t have much to say about it anymore.

Can you guess what it is?  They weren\\'t vaccinated. Some by choice. Some were sick before the vaccine was available. \\n\\nAs it turns out, I\\'m well aware of the protests around the world.

So you\\'re suggestion to question everything is interesting, because that\\'s exactly what I do. While the pro vax crowd and liberal leaning media aren\\'t perfect (Ivermectin is not simply horse dewormer you assholes...), they are not manipulating the results as much as many conservative sources.  I\\'ve actually say down with raw data and tested claims made by the anti vax crowd and found significant manipulation of results. You state that vaccines don\\'t work, yet such a blanket statement is not supported by a thorough analysis. I\\'ve outlined my findings in the occasional post reply here on Reddit. \\n\\nSo, in summary, I question a lot of things. I question government overreach. I question our loss of freedom. I question governments implementing vaccine mandates to keep a job (though I support a company\\'s right to fire an employee for lack of vax because I believe in freedom of association - I still don\\'t like it, but I support their right). \\nI also question people making claims based on scientific findings that are not within the scope of the original study - and often find cherry picking and manipulation is used to support these false claims. You have made the statement that the vaccines don\\'t work, but that statement in itself is silly. What do you mean by \"doesn\\'t work\"? Are you suggesting that they offer no protection from the virus? That one with the vaccine is more likely to be harmed than one without? That the vaccine doesn\\'t meet your standard of what does or doesn\\'t work?  What is your basis of effectiveness that leads you to conclude that the vaccine doesn\\'t work?\\n\\nEdit-typos.

Its called peer review and empiricism. if you want one man to define what reality is to you, join a fucking church and listen to the priest.\\n\\nQaim is a German professor of agricultural economics, a field focusing on the global economics of food. Of course he is gonna say that Monsanto boosted yields at the time with studies that were cherry picking data in a short time frame. It would invalidate his entire school of thought to say that India was hurt by foreign business because his entire university department is about how globalization works to better nations.\\n\\nYet you somehow say the crops work to boost yields, but now they do not boost yields because they are only 5%? **Your opinion is simply regurgitating what last study you read. You keep flip flopping every time I give you a study and now you are saying the opposite thing from what you just said.**\\n\\nYou don\\'t care about fact because you rather twist words around in an attempt to \"win\" even when you admit you don\\'t know shit about the subject but somehow know enough to deny everything and say none of it matters to be serious.\\n\\nContrarianism is not critical thinking.',\n",

Outdoor environmental variables, such as cold temperatures and low wind speed, have been correlated with incidence and mortality from Covid-19 (caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus). However, as Covid-19 predominantly spreads indoors, the degree to which outdoor environmental variables might directly cause disease spread is unclear. Methods. World regions were considered to have reliable data if the excess mortality did not greatly exceed reported Covid-19 mortality. The relative risk of Covid-19 mortality for 142 regions as a function of median weekly temperature and wind speed was determined. For instance, Covid-19 mortality following warm weeks in a country was compared with mortality following cold weeks in the same country. Results. Covid-19 mortality increases with cooling from 20 C to close to freezing (0 to 4 C, p<0.001). The relation of Covid-19 mortality with temperature demonstrates a maximum close to freezing. Below -5 C, the decrease in mortality with further cooling was statistically significant (p<0.01). With warming above room temperature (20 to 24 C), there is a nonsignificant trend for mortality to increase again. A literature review demonstrated that window opening and indoor ventilation tend to increase with warming in the range from freezing to room temperature. Conclusion. The steep decline in Covid-19 mortality with warming in the range from freezing to room temperature may relate to window opening and less indoor crowding when it is comfortable outside. Below freezing, all windows are closed, and further cooling increases stack ventilation (secondary to indoor-outdoor temperature differences) and thereby tends to decrease Covid-19 mortality. Opening windows and other tools for improving indoor ventilation may decrease the spread of Covid-19.\",\"I've noticed some jaw pain on both my upper and lower jaw as well, although I think my upper jaw pain is probably just from sleeping weird.\",Wow this blew my mind. It's refreshing to see well thought out and informed comments and posts like this,\"If a virus with one or two mutations is transmitted from one host to another, the mutation is usually cancelled out when it returns to the pool of wild viruses in the population. In other words, it's highly unlikely that the 50 odd mutations of Omicron mutated in 50 individuals before they added up in one host.\n",
       "\n",
       "If an immunocompromised patient can't clear the virus for many months, it has the opportunity to add up many mutations in that patient as it fights the deficient immune system and/or any monoclonal treatment such a patient may be given. Since the patient can't clear the virus, the virus gets better at surviving in the host.\n",
       "\n",
       "The mutations are on an individual level what the variants are on the social level. Like the individual that can't clear the virus brings about new mutations, a society that can't deal with the pandemic brings about new variants.\",\"But we have to judge based on it being specifically marriage.
